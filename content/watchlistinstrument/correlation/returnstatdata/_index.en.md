This evaluation includes the **annual return** and certain **statistical data** for an **individual instrument**.
- **Period**: The **return** is calculated over the entire period of the available end-of-day prices. The period for calculating the statistical data can possibly be controlled by entering a period.
- **Client and instrument currency**: The currency of the instrument may differ from the currency of the client. Therefore, the calculated results are displayed in two columns. For currency pairs and Forex, this calculation is not performed in the client's currency.

### Yield
The calculations are based on the last available closing prices within one year, at best this would be from December 31 of the previous year to December 31 of the year to be evaluated. If **dividends** are available for the relevant instrument, these are also added, with the **ex-date** determining the year allocation.
- The calculation includes the entire period, which is defined by the available end-of-day prices.

#### Return per calendar year
The return is calculated for each calendar year and the current year.

#### Annualized return
The annualized return only includes complete calendar years, therefore the current year is not included.

### Statistical data
This hierarchy table currently shows the standard deviation for all three periods. The maximum profit or loss is also shown from the end-of-day prices.
- The calculations take into account possible user settings relating to a time period.
- The annual standard deviation is calculated from the standard deviation of the monthly returns.
