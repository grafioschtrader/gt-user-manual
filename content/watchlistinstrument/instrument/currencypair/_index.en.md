GT supports **portfolios**, **accounts**, **instruments** and **transactions** in different currencies. Therefore, the **currency pair** is essential for GT. GT attempts to treat **fiat currencies** and certain **cryptocurrencies** in the same way.

+ A **currency pair** can be generated by the **system**. A currency pair is created in the background if it does not already exist, for example if you create an account with a currency that differs from the portfolio currency.
+ The **standard currency connectors** can be found in the "**Global settings**".
+ A **currency pair** can be created **manually**.
+ Supported **cryptocurrencies** are BTC, BNB, ETH, ETC, LTC, XRP. It should be noted that cryptocurrency data sources only provide intraday or historical price data for the most important world currencies such as USD, EUR, JPY, GBP and CHF.
+ A **currency pair** **cannot be traded**; a corresponding **security** or **derived instrument** must be available for trading. This is based on an **asset class** with **Forex** as the **financial instrument**.
