This dialog can be used to select existing instruments. There is a single and multiple selection:

- **Single selection**: Only a single **instrument** can be selected and transferred from the search result set. This is used, for example, when **importing transactions**.
- **Multiple selection**: **Several instruments** can be selected from the results of the search from a table. This multiple selection is used in the **watchlist** and **correlation matrix** for adding instruments.
- The search criteria are an AND operation and therefore an instrument found must fulfill all criteria.
