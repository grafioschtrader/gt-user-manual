No public prices are provided for certain securities such as fixed-term deposits. For this purpose, there is "**Historical prices for period**". This **tab** is automatically activated when editing the **security** if a **stock exchange** without price data is selected. If the price does not change over the **entire term**, it corresponds to the **denomination**.

## Historical prices for period" tab
If the rate has fluctuated, it can be entered under this **tab**, where the rate and the date for the new rate are entered.

Additional information can be found in the [price data](../../../) video.
