## Control elements
GT consists of different operating elements. Some **control elements** are more extensive than others and allow settings to be made for the interaction element itself.

### Table
The **Table**, **Tree** and **Hierarchy table** controls are the basic interaction elements of GT.

#### "Web memory" and table
The table is a frequently used **interaction element** in GT for the presentation of data. In some views, the web browser saves certain settings relating to the displayed columns in the **local memory**. This [web storage](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Storage) is not deleted when the web browser is closed and is available again for configuring the table in the next session.

#### Expanding table row
An **expander symbol** is visible in the first column of certain tables. Clicking on it expands the table row vertically, making different details for this table row visible. Clicking on the **expander symbol** again reduces the table row to its original size.

#### Tooltip in header cell
A tooltip or quick info is implemented on some **header cells** of the **table header**. This appears when the mouse pointer hovers over the corresponding header cell for a short time.
