The following information is not relevant for the "normal" user of Grafioschtrader. In the [wiki of the Grafioschtrader project on GitHub](//github.com/grafioschtrader/grafioschtrader/wiki) there are instructions on how to install, update and make changes to application.properties.

### Installation
Due to the client-server model of GT, the installation is very extensive, whereby the videos of the [Installation and Update](//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHbd4\_zqbsPJZjoZktsKBQVx7JR\_9AuGR) playlist on YouTube can help you with this. Before installation, we recommend that you read the content of [Different types of installation](./installationbefore/). After the installation of GT, some shared data is already available by default, see [After the installation of GT](./installationafter/).

### Update Grafioschtrader
With most software systems, after the installation is before the update. This is no different with Grafioschtrader.

### Settings in application.properties
Certain system-wide settings must be adjusted or extended via `application.properties` or in `application-production.properties`.
