The daily performance of one or more portfolios can only be calculated if the **historical price data** is as complete as possible. Therefore, the historical price data of the securities can be viewed grouped by **stock exchange** or **connector**.
- These statistics are updated once a day.
- The calculation of completeness is based on the trading calendar of a stock exchange.

## Handling completeness
The view can be found via the **navigation area** under **Administrative data**. The view consists of a **hierarchy table** and a **table**. The hierarchy table can be grouped by **stock exchange** or **connector**. If grouped by **stock exchange**, the hierarchy consists of the connector and the combination of asset class and financial instrument. When grouping by connector, the hierarchy is structured by stock exchange and the combination of asset class and financial instrument.

## Properties and table columns
The properties are self-explanatory and have already been largely explained in [Historical price data](../../watchlistinstrument/externaldata/historyquote/pricedata).

## Functions
For the selected security, the usual functions for historical price data are offered via the context menu.
