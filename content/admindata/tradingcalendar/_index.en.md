The "**Global trading calendar**" and the trading calendar per stock exchanges are used to check the completeness of historical price data.

This defines the **upper set of** **trading days** for all **stock exchanges**. In principle, **no trading** takes place on **Saturdays** and **Sundays**. In most cases, only January 1 and December 25 are entered as global **non-trading days**.

## Edit global trading calendar
Only the **administrator** has the necessary **user rights** to make changes to this trading calendar. Alternately, the trading day under the mouse pointer becomes a public holiday or trading day by clicking on it. The year cannot be changed if the existing annual calendar still has unsaved changes.
