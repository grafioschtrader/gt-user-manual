[{"content":"Introduction A VIDEO will follow …\nWhy exists Grafioschtrader (GT) For several years I used a portfolio management application that met my initial needs. Over time, I realized that transaction and custody costs have a significant impact on the overall portfolio return. So I searched different online stock brokers that offered the most favorable trading conditions for my investment. So far, only a combination of several trading platforms satisfies my needs. As a Swiss investor, sooner or later investments are made with foreign currencies.\nOver time, you lose track of where how much is invested in what. In addition, there is no overview of the overall performance of all portfolios. I thought this does not have to be and as a software developer I plunged into the adventure Grafioschtrader.\nWhat can GT  The software is free and open source: GT is released as open source and can be found on GitHub. Multi-tenancy: GT can be run for a group of investors or in single mode. Web application: GT is a web application and provides the clearest results using a desktop web browser. Multiple portfolios with currency accounts: Replicates multiple portfolios with one or more securities accounts and one or more bank cash accounts. Multiple currencies: Trading securities in different currencies Trading from the turn of the millennium: Basic support for historical price data from the year 2000 onwards, noting that obtaining price data from non-traded securities may be a problem. Different financial instruments: Stocks, Bonds, ETF, securities without price data, short ETF, CFD, Forex. Import of transactions: An import of single or multiple PDFs with securities transactions Via CSV file, account transactions can also be loaded. Evaluations by asset classes: Evaluations by common asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.  For whom is suitable GT GT is the attempt to replicate the portfolios according to the reality, therefore there are accounts as in your online stock broker. Each booking is linked to a cash account, so the bookings are replicated according to your trading platform.\n The investor who does not want to entrust his financial data to a non-transparent platform. You can host the GT yourself, all you need is a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB memory. A shareholder who wants to have a history of all his trades. You can view all closed positions at any time. Private investor who wants to know how his currency gains are developing. The currency profit on the foreign currency accounts is shown continuously. Investors club that wants to host their own GT instance and a member is happy to take care of technical aspects. Investors with multiple portfolios on different trading platforms. GT provides information per portfolio and can display it in aggregated form.  For whom GT is not made  The day trader lacks real-time quotes. Investors who want to manage their trading detached from cash accounts. Investor who has only one portfolio with an online broker and the evaluations there are sufficient.  For whom GT does not work  For billionaires, in whatever currency, here the number format of GT is unfortunately not sufficient. For investors who want to manage transaction with GT before 2000. GT consistently implements double-digit years. For investors who want to assign an instrument to a sector/topic and countries/regions at the same time. For investors from Switzerland, Germany or USA who need a Valor-No., Securities Identification Number (WKN) or CUSIP-Number. GT uses the International Securities Identification Number ISIN and the not always unique ticker/symbols.   Info The information in this help refers to GT version 0.25.0.\n  ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Introduction","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/intro/"},{"content":"Grafioschtrader This is a small overview of the architecture of the application: You can find more information at GitHub.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Grafioschtrader","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/"},{"content":"Client english\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Client","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/tenantportfolio/client/"},{"content":"Return and statistical data ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Return and statistical data","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/watchlistinstrument/correlation/returnstatdata/"},{"content":"Correlation matrix ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Correlation matrix","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/watchlistinstrument/correlation/"},{"content":"Asset class ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Asset class","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/basedata/instrumentbased/assetclass/"},{"content":"Cash transaction english\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Cash transaction","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/transaction/account/"},{"content":"Stockexchange ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Stockexchange","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/basedata/instrumentbased/stockexchange/"},{"content":"Stock exchange and asset class ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Stock exchange and asset class","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/basedata/instrumentbased/"},{"content":"User Interface The application takes place in a web browser, therefore GT is a client-serve application. Usually, this is referred to as a client-server application, which includes a front-end and a server as back-end. The client is a single page web application that consists of a single HTML document after login. Individual page sections are dynamically refreshed or replaced. The server becomes a pure data provider for the client after the first pages of GT have been called. The user-friendly preparation of the data is done by the web browser.\nSubdivision user interface Besides the Menu bar, the user interface is divided into three parts, the Navigation Area, Main Area and the Additional Area. By moving the Divider between these areas, you can adjust the size of the areas according to your needs. If the current content implements a command, this area can be activated. The activation is represented by a blue frame. This activation will adjust the View and Edit menus according to the active content. The menu items of the Edit submenu are also available in the context menu, so frequently used commands can be reached more quickly. In a desktop web browser the context menu appears with the mouse right click.\nMenu bar The Setting and Logout and Help menu items are static.  Note Why the right mouse button?\nA large number of commands can be applied to certain entity. The implementation with buttons would take a lot of space.\n \nNavigation Area The Navigation Area contains the Navigation tree, via which the content of the Main Area is controlled. The navigation is hierarchically structured and has a mixture of static elements such as “Watchlist” and dynamic elements which are derived from your data.\nMain Area with data The Main Area reflects the content of the selected element in the Navigation tree. This area displays the data in tables or other structures. Often, the main area is divided into tabs. Clicking the corresponding tab brings another tab to the foreground.\nAdditional Area with graphics and data The Additional Area is located below the main area. Its content is largely controlled by the interactions in the Main Area, for example, by displaying a graphic about the data in the Main Area.\n Note Why these three areas?\nNew functionality can be easily integrated into these three areas. The navigation area can grow in depth and width. The main area can be supplemented with tabs and in the additional area various things can be mapped.\n  Dialog The collection of data by the user takes place exclusively via modal dialogs. A model dialog opens in the foreground and reduces user interaction to this dialog. The visibility of a modal dialog is indicated by a lightbox, with the web page darkening in the background. The modal dialog allows entities like transactions to be captured without violating the concept of a single page web application, i.e. the current page is not left.\nEditing an entity in a dialog is designed to be very interactive. The user’s input changes the visibility of the input elements, i.e. input fields become visible or invisible others in turn change their interactivity.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"User interface","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/intro/userinterface/"},{"content":"Controls …\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Web Storage, Controls and properties","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/intro/userinterface/user_setting_ui_controls/"},{"content":"Portfolio english\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Portfolio","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/tenantportfolio/portfolio/"},{"content":"Portfolio and Portfolios ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Portfolios and Portfolio","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/reportportfolio/portfolios/"},{"content":"Derived instrument english\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Derived instrument","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/watchlistinstrument/instrument/securityderived/derivedinstrument/"},{"content":"Security ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Security","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/watchlistinstrument/instrument/securityderived/security/"},{"content":"Security and derived instrument ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Security and derived instrument","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/watchlistinstrument/instrument/securityderived/"},{"content":"GT-PDF-Transform ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"GT-PDF-Transform","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/tenantportfolio/securityaccounts/transactionimport/gtpdftransform/"},{"content":"Asset value recognized transaction english\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Asset value recognized transaction","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/transaction/security/cashbased/"},{"content":"Global trading calendar ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Trading calendar","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/admindata/tradingcalendar/"},{"content":"Margin based transaction english\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Margin based transaction","uri":"/gt-user-manual/en/transaction/security/"},{"content":"Client and Portfolios GT defines a Client from the aggregation of all portfolios and watchlists.

In GT the watchlist is a central element. The following functions are accessible via the watchlist:\n Create and delete instruments: Instruments can only be created via a watchlist. Adding existing instruments: Existing instruments can be added to the watchlist. There is a limit to the number of instruments in a watchlist. Transaction on security: The recording of the first purchase transaction of a specific instrument must necessarily be done via a watchlist. Subsequent transactions such as a new purchase, dividend or sale can also be made via the security account. Intraday quotes update of the instruments: Only through the watchlist can the user actively cause an update of the Intraday quotes. There is a system setting for the time interval before a new update of the rates takes place. The update is done automatically with the selection of the corresponding watchlist in the navigation area. The watchlist itself is private data, but its content is based on shared data. Monitoring external data sources: Monitoring of historical and intraday price data and the resulting necessary actions.
